## Manipulating-Arrays

* Array a: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
* Array b: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
* Array c: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 9

- Sum: 
Write a Method that accepts an array of ints as a parameter, and returns the sum of all of the values in that array. The return type should be an int.

- Average:
Write a Method that takes an array of ints as a parameter, and returns the average of all of the values in that array. The return type should be a double.

- Reverse:
Write a Method that accepts an array of ints as a parameter, and prints out the values in that array in reverse order. The return type should be void.

- Maximum:
Write a Method that takes an array of ints as a parameter, and returns the largest value in that array. The return type should be an int.

- Rotating Arrays:
Arrays can be rotated to the right or to the left by any number of places. Rotating an array to the right by two places puts the first element in position three, the second element in position four, and so on, with the last element in position two and the next to last element in position one. Array a rotated to the right by two places results becomes [8, 10, 0, 2, 4, 6]. Likewise, rotating an array to the left places the first elements at the end. Array b rotated to the left by two places results in [5, 7, 9, 1, 3].

- Write a Method that accepts two parameters, an array, and the number of places to rotate that array to the left. This Method will print out the rotated array. This Method will return void.

- Sorting Arrays:
Write a Method that takes an unsorted array of ints as it's one parameter, and prints out all of the numbers in that array in sorted order
